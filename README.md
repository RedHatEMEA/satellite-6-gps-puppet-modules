# satellite-6-gps-puppet-modules

The goal of this project is to create a set of puppet modules that we, as consultants, can all use on Satellite 6 engagements. I would really like to ensure that each module can be customised via the Satellite 6 web UI (from the Smart Class Parameter tab)

## General Guidelines
Please create a branch to keep your own modules in and create pull-requests. Also, please make sure to run puppet-lint on all content (ideally as a pre-commit hook)

Please start all modules with sat6-    So for example sat6-ntp

Dont worry about creating the most technically perfect module before uploading
